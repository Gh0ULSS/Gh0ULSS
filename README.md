### Bio

Hi, I am Min and I am a prospective masters student and have just finished my Bachelors of Computer Science at the University of Wollongong and have studied Information Technology at Diploma level previously. I hope to use all my experience to the fullest to make the most out of my university experience. I have a strong passion in Cyber Security which will push my problem solving skills to greater heights due to the emphasis of critical thinking involved.
